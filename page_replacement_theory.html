                            <p>The page replacement algorithm decides which memory page is to be replaced. The process
                                of replacement is sometimes called swap out or write to disk. Page replacement is done
                                when the requested page is not found in the main memory (page fault).</p>

                            <br><br>
                            <p>There are two main aspects of virtual memory, Frame allocation and Page Replacement. It
                                is very important to have the optimal frame allocation and page replacement algorithm.
                                Frame allocation is all about how many frames are to be allocated to the process while
                                the page replacement is all about determining the page number which needs to be replaced
                                in order to make space for the requested page.</p>
                            <p>Page Fault – A page fault happens when a running program accesses a memory page that is
                                mapped into the virtual address space but not loaded in physical memory.

                                Since actual physical memory is much smaller than virtual memory, page faults happen. In
                                case of a page fault, Operating System might have to replace one of the existing pages
                                with the newly needed page. Different page replacement algorithms suggest different ways
                                to decide which page to replace. The target for all algorithms is to reduce the number
                                of page faults. </p>
                            <h3 class="h3">What If the algorithm is not optimal?</h3>
                            <p>1. if the number of frames which are allocated to a process is not sufficient or accurate
                                then there can be a problem of thrashing. Due to the lack of frames, most of the pages
                                will be residing in the main memory and therefore more page faults will occur.</p>
                            <p>However, if OS allocates more frames to the process then there can be internal
                                fragmentation.

        </div>
        </p>
        <p>2. If the page replacement algorithm is not optimal then there will also be the problem
            of thrashing. If the number of pages that are replaced by the requested pages will be
            referred in the near future then there will be more number of swap-in and swap-out and
            therefore the OS has to perform more replacements then usual which causes performance
            deficiency.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the task of an optimal page replacement algorithm is to choose the page which
            can limit the thrashing.</p>
        <h3 class="h3">Types of Page Replacement Algorithms</h3>
        <p>There are various page replacement algorithms. Each algorithm has a different method by
            which the pages can be replaced.</p>
        <ol class="points">
            <li><strong>Optimal Page Replacement algorithm →</strong> this algorithms replaces the
                page which will not be referred for so long in future. Although it can not be
                practically implementable but it can be used as a benchmark. Other algorithms are
                compared to this in terms of optimality.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Least Recently used (LRU) Page Replacement algorithm →</strong> this algorithm
                replaces the page which has not been referred for a long time. This algorithm is
                just opposite to the optimal page replacement algorithm. In this, we look at the
                past instead of staring at future. </li><br>
            <li><strong>First In First Out (FIFO) Page Replacement algorithm →</strong> This is the simplest page
                replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the
                operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of
                the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
                <br><br>
                Belady’s anomaly – Belady’s anomaly proves that it is possible to have more page faults when increasing
                the number of page frames while using the First in First Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm.
